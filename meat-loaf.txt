NGREDIENTS

1 1/2 pounds ground beef
1 2-ounce envelope onion soup mix
1 cup shredded Italian cheese blend
1 cup fresh flat-leaf parsley, chopped (optional)
2 eggs
1 1/2 cups saltines (about 4 ounces), finely ground
1/3 cup water
1/2 cup barbeque sauce (optional)
DIRECTIONS

Heat oven to 400Â° F. In a large bowl, combine the beef, soup mix, cheese, parsley (if using), eggs, and saltines. Add the water and combine.
Transfer the meat mixture to a baking dish and form it into a 9-inch loaf. Bake until cooked through, about 40 minutes.
If using barbecue sauce, remove the meat loaf from oven after 25 minutes and pour the sauce over the top. Return to oven for about 15 minutes more.
